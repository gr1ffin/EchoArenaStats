## Installation



## File Usage/Settings
In the **/Storage** folder, there are different files. 
* `dailyData.json` & `savedData.json` should be left alone. This is how data is stored. You can manually change data here if you want to.
* `settings.json` holds the configuration for the program. In this file, you input your username, and if on Quest, you change the IP to match that of your headset. 
* `Overlay.txt`,`Stats.txt` & `Daily.txt` are the files that will be displayed in OBS.
